1. Navigate to whatever directory you want to save the SSH key to.
2. Open Git Bash
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "mlmicahlongmire@gmail.com"
Name the key and set a passphrase. (In this case, TheTome & TheTome.pub)
cat TheTome.pub
3. Copy all the contents and navigate to here: https://github.com/settings/keys
4. Add the key to your SSH keys.
5. ssh-add.exe the private key and enter the passphrase.
6. Turn on ssh-add
eval `ssh-agent -s`
7. Add your key.
ssh-add.exe /d/Keys/.ssh/TheTome
8. Test using 'ssh -T git@github.com'.
It should return: Hi bobbyhiddn! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.

Now, we need to get our repo publishing:

First, initialize a git repo in the directory of your choice:
git init
git add . - Adds all files in directory.
git commit -m "First commit"
git branch -m main
Create a repository in github and find the url, for example: git@github.com:bobbyhiddn/Test.git
(You can do this from cmd line by accessing GIT's REST API.)
(To do this, you'll need to generate a Personal Access Token from this site: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new)
(Set the expiration and give it full repo access and user access)
(curl -u "<username>:<token>" https://api.github.com/user/repos -d '{"name":"<repo>"}')
Now add it as a remote:
git remote add origin git@github.com:bobbyhiddn/Test.git
And push your master/main branch to it: 
git push -u origin main
Navigate to your github page and make sure your repo is visible and files are present.
